He is currently enforcing rebuilding efforts in the city. He believes he is strong, and will become stronger if he is not enough. He rules with an Iron Fist for his charge.

## History

Enoch, like most of the other elves of this land, was born in the Feywild and immigrated near [its infancy](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Big%20Lore\Timeline.md#the-age-of-beginning). He survived the [Great Fires](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\Great%20Fires.md), and aligned himself with [The Church of the White Flame](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\The%20Church%20of%20the%20White%20Flame.md). He enlisted in their Guardianship Program and became a Patron of [Baskin](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Northwestern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\Baskin.md). Soon after, he discovered his powers gifted to him by [Its Greatness](..\..\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md) for his devotion to conquest in the Church's name. He is recognized as one of the few Spoken of the Church, but given his friendly nature, few realize this.
