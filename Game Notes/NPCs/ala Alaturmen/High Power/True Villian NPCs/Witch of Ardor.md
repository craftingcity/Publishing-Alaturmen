The Witch of Ardor made a deal with the patriarch of [The Arstoviches](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper\Factions\The%20Arstoviches.md) for power in exchange for his child. Unspecified, and therefore interpreted in its broadest meaning. After his natural death, she erased his name and cursed his children's bloodline â€“ and after the turn of the half-century, the Arstoviches became the first of Alaturmen cursed with Vamparism.

Though the Witch died not long after her work was completed, by [Arthur Simonson](..\Nobles%20of%20Prosper%20NPCs\Arthur%20Simonson.md)'s hand, her spirit was not satisfied, and she now resides as a haunting presence in the Outskirts of *Aurgurs*, withering with time.
