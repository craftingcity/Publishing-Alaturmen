# Nicolas Talaveem

## the Yellow Mage

## Keeper of Darktower

#### he/him/his

 > 
 > A man of worn face and dark eyes. Perhaps his body is some 70 years, but his [soul bears a dark ancient mark](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\Marked%20By%20the%20Fire.md). He wears a gray cloak around his thin form. He holds a crooked staff of dark wood. It bears a crack that emits a dull arcane light.

Nicolas is a first-generation human. He was born to two [Fieldborn](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Big%20Lore\Heritages\Human%20Specifics.md) who lived in a human settlement under the protection of [Minyostalma](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\The%20Old.md). He was orphaned by the [Great Fires](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\Great%20Fires.md), and was of the few who were spared in the event. He was adopted by [a family of elves](..\Barons%20of%20Combine%20NPCs\Baron%20Yassir%20Cassindil.md) that collected orphaned survivors of their [ancestral home](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\The%20Old.md).

## History

As a child, Nicolas witnessed a horrible holy act, the [Great Fires](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\Great%20Fires.md). He was [Marked By the Fire](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\Marked%20By%20the%20Fire.md). His adoptive family, the [Cassindils](..\Barons%20of%20Combine%20NPCs\Baron%20Yassir%20Cassindil.md), took him to their lands in the [Grumbling Hills](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Grumbling%20Hills.md) where he grew up in a small hamlet near [Aeberu](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Southeast%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20city\Aeberu.md).

Under the sponsorship and watch of the Cassindil family, Nicolas began to learn the sport of wand-weaving. His adoptive parents were quite surprised to find him quickly becoming a formidable opponent. 

As Nicolas began to reach adulthood, he was at the top of his skills in the sport of wand-evokation. He felt that no opponent could match him. He used his connections to the Cassindil family to begin to collect a personal collection of arcane texts of various sources. He was soon approached by [The Wizard In Blue](..\Guild%20Employee%20NPCs\Guilded%20Wizard%20NPCs\The%20Wizard%20In%20Blue.md), and was convinced to join the [Guild of Wizards](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Guilds%20of%20Coalition\Guild%20of%20Wizards.md). Nicolas hides knowledge from his peers as he can - especially of [Its Greatness](..\..\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md) - wherever he can.

Nicolas used the principles he used in wand-weaving to being to craft his own magics, creating personal spells and wards.

Nicolas keeps a lair, *Darktower*, northwest of Aeberu.
