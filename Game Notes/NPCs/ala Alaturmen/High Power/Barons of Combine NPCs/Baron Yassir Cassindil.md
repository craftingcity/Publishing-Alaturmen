A second generation elf. The Baron of the [Grumbling Hills](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Grumbling%20Hills.md), held with great standing with the [Coalition City](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Coalition%20City.md). 

Known to be helpful to those lost or without a home, true to the family Cassindil's name.

## History

Born to the elven family Cassindil, one of the ancient houses of [Minyostalma](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\The%20Old.md), Yassir is a second generation elf, born in the [Grumbling Hills](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Grumbling%20Hills.md).

As a child, Yassir was told of the tales of [Minyostalma](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\The%20Old.md) and their great centers of trade, knowledge, and charity. As they grew on the streets of [Aeberu](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Southeast%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20city\Aeberu.md), they gained the trust of their peers that controlled enterprises that began to grow, and soon Yassir began to have powerful friends.

At thirty, they controlled [Aeberu](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Southeast%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20city\Aeberu.md) with a kind hand, an honest tongue, and the favor of the most powerful people in the city.

At fourty, they controlled all of the territory in the [Grumbling Hills](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Grumbling%20Hills.md) by the same virtues.
