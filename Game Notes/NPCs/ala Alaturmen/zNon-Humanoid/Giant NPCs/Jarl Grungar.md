# The Jarl of the Grungarian Frost Giant Clan

Grungar is the Jarl of an Frost Giant clan. He operates in an unnamed portion of the [Great Glacier](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\The%20Planes%20of%20Existence.md#great-glacier) in the [Plane of Ice](..\..\..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\The%20Planes%20of%20Existence.md#the-plane-of-ice). 

[Jarl Grungar](Jarl%20Grungar.md)'s War/Peace Goals:

* Escape the Ordening (mostly via leaving the elemental planes)
* Fight and Hunt (within a territory is acceptable, unrestricted prefered.)
* Be well fed and respected (we can fight about that; we're giants)
* Get shinies (jewelry/gems ONLY, minted peices are less useful to us)
