# PreNotes for Nov 27th

***DOMINATE PERSON ADVANTAGE ON FIGHTING MONSTER (OK TO CHEESE!!!)***

* [ ] DM Screen
* [ ] Module
* [ ] Notepaper
* [ ] Preread

[Kakurak](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Kakurak.md) spends the day identifying the chain. [Marcus](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Weak%20Power\Lower%20Holyl'nders\Marcus.md) alerts the party in the morning over a breakfast that he will not be joining them until their dinner. He will follow them about the place asking questions, keeping secrets, and cleaning up after the party.

Kakurak wishes to bestow upon the party two scrolls (of *comprehend languages* and *plane shift*) and a *ring of dragons' breath*.

Kakurak will ask the adventurers to continue their assault against the *Giants* and use the chain to enter [The Planes of Existence > The Plane of Ice](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\The%20Planes%20of%20Existence.md#the-plane-of-ice). There they will find the keep of the [Jarl Grungar](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\Jarl%20Grungar.md). It is their task to capture him alive if possible.

## Livenotes

[Grod](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Grod.md) is first generation dragonborn; [Kakurak](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Kakurak.md) gave many magics to the party.

They traveled.

[Bardaux](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Bardaux.md) used the *comprehend languages* scroll at the very beginning.

[Jarl Grungar](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\Jarl%20Grungar.md)'s Leutenents are Amaranth, Ludvatl, and Warung. The diplomacy ensues in [Kakurak's Lair](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Northwestern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20village\Kakurak's%20Lair.md). 

## Postnotes

The party spent a large portion of this session gearing up and then avoiding the fight they were gearing up for - at their patron's request.
I think that this makes a lot of sense for [Kakurak](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Kakurak.md)'s character, but as a game for my players, I think that it was not what they or I were expecting. I don't think that this is something to be rectified, the good party of the good patron found a non-violent way to end a conflict.

Lets define that more; what are the effects of this diplomatic union?
Some options...

* [Jarl Grungar](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\Jarl%20Grungar.md) follows through; creating his own space that does not allow the Ordening to be the social hierarchy. Storm and Hill giants are expected to work side by side.
* [Grungar](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\Jarl%20Grungar.md) is convinced enough to pull his soldiers from [King Snure](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\King%20Snure.md)'s war, and negotiates a union of space between his holding in [The Plane of Ice](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\The%20Planes%20of%20Existence.md#the-plane-of-ice) and a holding sponsored by [Kakurak](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Kakurak.md) on the Material Plane

I like option two the best. It gets the Jarl exactly what he wants and it gets Kakurak almost exactly what he wants. Kakurak has to swing this with the church, but it leaves a cool (haha get it) lasting impact on the world.
