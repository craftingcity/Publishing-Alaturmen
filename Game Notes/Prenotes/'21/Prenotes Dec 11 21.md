# Prenotes for Dec 11th

So far, [The Whitimores](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Groups\The%20Whitimores.md) have played only a background role in the story. I want them on the main stage alongside the Fire Giants of [King Snure](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\King%20Snure.md).

If the party waits for over a few days, the [The Whitimores](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Groups\The%20Whitimores.md)\] may execute [Jarl Grungar](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\Jarl%20Grungar.md) for failing to maintain the plan. The loyal Frost Giants are spared, and align themselves with [King Snure](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\King%20Snure.md) for the "grand invasion". This event will happen a week after the Jarl's Execution.

***DOMINATE PERSON ADVANTAGE ON FIGHTING MONSTER (OK TO CHEESE!!!)***

[Kakurak](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Kakurak.md) requests of the adventures that they walk [The Planes of Existence](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\The%20Planes%20of%20Existence.md) without a return ticket, under the assumption that the fire giants would have some way of transporting themselves here. [Kakurak](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Kakurak.md) admits to the adventurers that this is an extremely dangerous request, and he would not hold it against them should they refuse.

In either case, [The Whitimores](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Groups\The%20Whitimores.md) have plans for these meddling adventurers; a strike team has caught wind of their plans to stop the giants and will follow the adventurers for over a day before attacking at the most opportune time. Given victory, [The Whitimores](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Groups\The%20Whitimores.md) hold and interrogate these adventurers.

# Postnotes

This one was mostly improv. Kakurak played no role; Marcus verbally led the party to the town of [Baskin](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Northwestern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\Baskin.md), who was the most recent raided city from [The Assault of the Giant Decenters](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\The%20Assault%20of%20the%20Giant%20Decenters.md). Their church was covered in ice from the attack and harbored a Remorhaz mating pair, which the party has slain.

[The Whitimores](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Groups\The%20Whitimores.md) were watching the party, and they saw their opportunity to strike. Bardaux was last to leave the city's church and was shot by a poisoned arrow from a *Whitimore Assassin*, and quickly captured by the extraction team.

"You have something we want [Bardaux](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Bardaux.md)... [Varis](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Varis.md) has a greater role to play. I'm sure we'll speak again..." - An Unnamed Drow

I think that Varis' role is to be a Vessel for *Vhaeraun*, whom the Whitimore are attempting to bring into the world so that the house Whitimore can "win" the underdark (y'know bc they have a god on their side).

I used the names [Enoch Ben](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Mild%20Power\Tendered\Enoch%20Ben.md) for the wood elf captain of the guard in [Baskin](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Northwestern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\Baskin.md), [Valerio Avishalom](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Mild%20Power\Tendered\Valerio%20Avishalom.md) for the green dragonborn Grand Tendered of [Baskin](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Northwestern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\Baskin.md), and *Emuna Yanuv* as an unraced tavernkeep who opened her doors to the public refugees.

see [Varis](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Varis.md) and [Amashod](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Amashod.md) for post game work.
