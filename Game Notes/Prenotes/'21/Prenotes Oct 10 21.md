# Pre-Session notes for October 10th, Keep on the Hill Giant

[Varis](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Varis.md) and [Amashod](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Amashod.md) are raised by Kakurak, whose brother has since died. As a bound sorcerer, [Varis](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Varis.md) will comply with the request of Kakurak to infiltrate and assault the Keep of The Hill Giants. The rest of the party is offered a boon of friendship, but not binding. This is a oneshot, they will comply.

The Party Coalesces, and is introduced to a blind druid, [Marcus](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Weak%20Power\Lower%20Holyl'nders\Marcus.md) (level 6 druid, prefers bugs), to guide them. They have a prepared map (which we will print and hand to the players), and are ready and willing to be a guide to the structure. [Marcus](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Weak%20Power\Lower%20Holyl'nders\Marcus.md) has found the few secret doors of the Upper Works.

# Post-Live Notes

We did a lil intro with [Varis](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Varis.md)' death/revival, character creation took so long and I had to leave so early that we only got to fight the dogs, which the party dispatched with little trouble. They alerted a giant, however, who raised an intruder call. Under the effect of a dominate person spell from [Varis](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Varis.md), then called a false alarm. The party summilarily executed him quickly after (the "handsome hill giant" from area 19). His suitors are left waiting, and may possibly investigate.
