### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had returned safely to the surface, arriving in their home plane with their newest ally, [Gudeliva](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Underdark\Travelers\Gudeliva.md), and safely traveling to [Kakurak](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Kakurak.md)'s lair. There, they were alone, until [Kakurak](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Kakurak.md) soared into his sea-cave-lair, his trusty satyr servant [Marcus](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Weak%20Power\Lower%20Holyl'nders\Marcus.md) riding meekly atop him.

"We have much to discuss..."

### What does the World Know?
