After a quick stop in the [duergar city](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Heilich-Muwwoq.md), the party hired the drow guide [Gudeliva](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Underdark\Travelers\Gudeliva.md) to take them to [Ungaethram](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Ungaethram.md). The party is camped a few hundred yards away from the glowing city and banging machinery. 

You have just finished consuming your rations for tonight, your stomachs feel just full enough, when [Gudeliva](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Underdark\Travelers\Gudeliva.md) pulls a dark hidebound journal and opens it to a page in the front third and begins to speak (See [Gudeliva > The Checklist](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Underdark\Travelers\Gudeliva.md#the-checklist)).

## Travel

We are in the heart city of a large lush cavern, it will take four travel days to the edge of this cavern - we should gather as much food as we can - and then nearly two dozen travel days on the safe path, and maybe a handful or two less on the quickest path.

3d20 keep highest
safe = +5
mid = +/- 0
quick = -5

roll on the [Underdark Travel Table](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Tables\Underdark%20Travel%20Table.md) as normal

Quickest path goes past Dragon Lair and through Ootool.

Safest path goes down to the end of the Duergar territories, through [Deepburrow](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Deepburrow.md) and then past the grazing fields and then toward [Ungaethram](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Ungaethram.md).

# During Play

The party leaves the [Heilich-Muwwoq](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Heilich-Muwwoq.md) cavern, entering a 10 foot tunnel with no offshoots.
