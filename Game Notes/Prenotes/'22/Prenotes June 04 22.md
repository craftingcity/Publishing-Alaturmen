# Postnotes

The party of *Breenabelle*, *Jarren* & Pip, *Ulfgar*, *Nala* & ('lil fucker) accepted Alegra's quest by contract. They talked with a local alchemist to gather some more information. Then, after coming back to the Silver Unicorn to drink, Jarren started a bar fight with six drunk farmers.
