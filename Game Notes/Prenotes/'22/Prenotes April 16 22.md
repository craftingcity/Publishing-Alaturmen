# Prenotes for April 16th

* [ ] DM Screen
* [ ] Notepaper
* [ ] Prep
  * [ ] maps?
  * [ ] encounters / monsters?
  * [ ] intro / recap?

It has been 10 sleeps since you have seen the daylight. You four and your guide, [Gudeliva](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Underdark\Travelers\Gudeliva.md), sick as they are, recently fought a magical spider and took in its three live victims; Krenzo, Wyruq, and Blug. 

[Gudeliva](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Underdark\Travelers\Gudeliva.md) reassures the party that they will reach [Ootool](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Ootool.md) soon. Another day or two of travel along the Kingsroad and then one more to reach [Ootool](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Ootool.md). There they can leave the three unknowns and rest. They'll continue the journey when they recover (which would be four days after the two it takes to get to [Ootool](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Ootool.md) - the first day in [Ootool](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Ootool.md) will be the most painful).

# INGAME
