## INTRO

How have you been keeping track of the days down here?

You remember traveling towards the light of the city for a sleep after seeing the duergar patrol and a sleep after that. Three before then is when you first spotted it the light of the city. Another you fought with the metal-capped beasts that came from the ground. Another before you slept in the tunnels, and another before you were with your friend. You haven't seen Bardaux since that morning after the blue-ice insect creature and the drow in the crowd and [that wizard in the blue cloak](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Guild%20Employee%20NPCs\Guilded%20Wizard%20NPCs\The%20Wizard%20In%20Blue.md) gave you exactly as you asked for.

It has been 6 sleeps since you've seen daylight.

It has been longer still since your tenious peace with the Frost Giants. 

### Questions?

What has happened to [Jarl Grungar](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\Jarl%20Grungar.md)?

* kept his word - we'll hold troops back from [King Snure](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\King%20Snure.md)
  * some frost giants aren't under his control, attack anyway
  * most loyal clansfolk agree, let us abdicate the Ordening where we stand
  * [King Snure](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\King%20Snure.md) comes for his head

What has [King Snure](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Giant%20NPCs\King%20Snure.md) been up to?

* finishing *War Beast* :)
* wrecking shop in the northwest

Has Kakurak presented this as a great threat to the [Guild of Adventurers](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Guilds%20of%20Coalition\Guild%20of%20Adventurers.md)?

* yeah probably, but the [paperwork](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Texts\Guild%20Texts\Emergency%20Communicae%20c.%20103AF.md) for this stuff takes time, we can get an emergancy communicae approved in about a week (from when the deal was struck, the party went to investigate the most recently hit town and got snatched)

Name Drops for middeep:

[Lolth](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\General\Lolth.md), Spider Queen

*Vhaeraun*, Progenitor

remember travel rules; any rest = 1 ration / traveler, action based in game - can look to [alexandrian hexcrawl](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46116/roleplaying-games/5e-hexcrawl-part-3-watch-actions) as similar, loved watches of travel and rest; i like the idea of more crunchy travel, but I dont really like the idea of more crunchy travel.

introduce fun npcs this session - lots of actually cool duergar and otherwise gangsters / mercs

# During Notes

A pile of goo and body parts fell from the top of the cavern.

* a gift from *A'zi'imli'ku*'s servants

As they entered the town, [Varis](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Varis.md) gave his name in an attempt to buy information for fake drugs.

After spending some time in town, they hired [Gudeliva](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Underdark\Travelers\Gudeliva.md) to guide them to the Vault City [Ungaethram](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Ungaethram.md).

They end the session after consuming rations going to sleep - need to do watches.
