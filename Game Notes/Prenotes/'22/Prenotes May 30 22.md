# Prenotes for May 30th

* [ ] DM Screen
* [ ] Notepaper
* [ ] Prep
  * [ ] maps?
  * [ ] encounters / monsters?
  * [ ] intro / recap?

I have the encounter prep in paper somewhere.

I talked with Grandpa to see about his two characters, he said if given the option, he would continue to play Kursk, I suggested that this means Bardaux is my NPC now - he seemed ammicable and accepted this.

[Alylay Whitimore](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Underdark\Whitimore\Alylay%20Whitimore.md) carries [Alylay's Journal](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Texts\Alylay's%20Journal.md) and the Alliance contract in the shelves in the [Whitimore's Last Hold](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Whitimore's%20Last%20Hold.md).

#### During Game

The Whitimores escaped via their plans; the Concubines, Alylay, all the Archers, and the prisoners escaped into the Plane of Fire and Snure's Keep.

The party gathered [Alylay's Journal](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Texts\Alylay's%20Journal.md) and the Alliance Contract between the Whitimore and the Giants.

For the most part, they're on the right track for solving the mystery, though after asking both [Amashod](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Amashod.md) and [Varis](..\..\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Kakurak's%20Chosen\Varis.md)'s players they believe .

After the fight against the Whitimores, they received more information from the Atriarch of [Ootool](..\..\..\Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Underdark\Locations%20&%20Holdings\Ootool.md), specifically regarding Vhaeraun.
