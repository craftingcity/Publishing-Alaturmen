In the northwest, the Howling Warrens.

To its east, Darklake, home of the Ziggurat Kou-toa.

Further, the old human mining colony of Ammyrian. The Duergar make their home here, and spread to the south in fewer numbers.

West of their southern reaches, the settlement of Ootool is said to have been made by the Illithid, but this sounds unlikely, as noone has seen one come forth from the ruins on which the settlement is built

West-south-west, the Settlement of Durgg-Likin is a goblin settlement.

West further, the Long River. This connects the Howling warrens and the Troglodyte territory to its south.

Northeast of the territory of troglodytes, the old Inverted Tower remains untouched, as its wards and traps still take victim.

Northeast still, a large vault contains the Drow city of [Ungaethram](Ungaethram.md). 

To their east, a dragon hunts.

South-south-east, a dwarven settlement in Deepburrow. They are of the [Dwarven Kingdom Actstow](..\..\Alaturmen\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Dwarven%20Kingdoms\Dwarven%20Kingdom%20Actstow.md) to the far north of [Coalition City](..\..\Alaturmen\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Coalition%20City.md).

Far to its south, [Ootool](Ootool.md) is a fungal city, home to all in the underdark. This is where [The Whitimores](..\Groups\The%20Whitimores.md) fled to after being exiled from [Ungaethram](Ungaethram.md).

Centered between the *Inverted Tower*, [Deepburrow](Deepburrow.md), and [Ungaethram](Ungaethram.md) is the *Grazing Fields*. This place is lush with growth, attracting hunter and gatherer alike. This area is fruitful, but very dangerous.

South of the Fields, a fungal forest leeches some of the prosperity that the Fields see.

Slightly northeast is [Growth Heart](Growth%20Heart.md). A ruin of an old druid's attempts at making the underdark a more comfortable place.

South some, the crystal sea spans far.
