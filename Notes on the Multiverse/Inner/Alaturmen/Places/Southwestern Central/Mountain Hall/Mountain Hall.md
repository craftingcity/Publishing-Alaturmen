# Description

Mountain Hall is the dwarven monarchy that holds much of the riches of [Deakred Range](..\..\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Deakred%20Range.md).

It is ruled by a "King" who gets two votes in the democratic council of the Clans of dwarves living in Mountain Hall.

During the time of [Great Fires](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\Great%20Fires.md), the personal collection of *Frin Copperhammer* was lost and spread by the refugees of that catastrophe.
