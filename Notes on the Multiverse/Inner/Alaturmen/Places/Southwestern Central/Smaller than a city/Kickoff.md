# Description

Kickoff's main industry is mining and exporting durandurm crystal, a powerful magical component; beautiful clear crystal that is most commonly used in the focusing of raw elemental magic. 

The way that the crystal resonates with the Weave creates a direct line into the elemental planes, and artificers have recently ([Timeline > The Second Age The Age of Wonder](..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Timeline.md#the-second-age-the-age-of-wonder)) manufactured certain weapons that use this powerful leyline to fire small pellets and rocks over long distances.

The flux of prosperity has been halted short by the ongoing raids of [The Outlands](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\Lands%20of%20Tetrimoc\The%20Outlands.md) by its [Nomad Tribes](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\Lands%20of%20Tetrimoc\The%20Outlands.md#nomad-tribes) and the [Thieves Guilds](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\Lands%20of%20Tetrimoc\The%20Outlands.md#thieves).

## Physicality of the Holding

The medium sized mining town is built of wood structures grouped closely together.

## Defenses

Kickoff is one of the few holdings in [The Outlands](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\Lands%20of%20Tetrimoc\The%20Outlands.md) that is not under [a team of thieves'](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\Lands%20of%20Tetrimoc\The%20Outlands.md#thieves) control. They use their own *Durandurm Weaponry* to defend themselves from threats of the outside world. Given that they are located in between [Agrandica](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Mild%20Power\Thief%20Lords%20of%20the%20Desert\Agrandica.md)'s and [Barthalamule](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Mild%20Power\Thief%20Lords%20of%20the%20Desert\Barthalamule.md)'s area of control, they often make attempts to gain control of the town. They are never fully successful, as they are contended by the other of the two whenever they attempt.
