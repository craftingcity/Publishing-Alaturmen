# North East Central Alaturmen

Much of the North East is civilized. The outskirts of this area are densely inhabited by hobgoblin, while the interior is densely populated by goblin, human, and others. These two groups (referring specifically to the [The Kingdom of Prosper](..\..\About%20People\Nations\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper.md) and the [Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Territories](..\..\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Blood%20Clans\Blood-Hobgoblin%20Clan%20Territories.md)) are both governed, and do not openly war at this time.
