The Alavini River seperates the land of [The Democratic Combine of Peoples](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\The%20Democratic%20Combine%20of%20Peoples\The%20Democratic%20Combine%20of%20Peoples.md) and [The Deserts of Tetrimoc](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\Lands%20of%20Tetrimoc\The%20Deserts%20of%20Tetrimoc.md). It is often home to many boats crossing up and down the river doing trade and transport. It meets the [Deakred Range](Deakred%20Range.md) at [Coalition City](..\..\..\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Coalition%20City.md), the mountains' most eastern end.
