The Gabrin Shrublands are a wide but minor barony. It holds *Goldfield* and *Thingrass*. It is currently controlled entirely by [Baron Shimmer](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Barons%20of%20Combine%20NPCs\Baron%20Shimmer.md), although, the ports of this land are their only true cares.
