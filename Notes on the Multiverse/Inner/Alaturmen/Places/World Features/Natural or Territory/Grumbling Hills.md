While no major holdings are in the Grumbling Hills, the much [Hillkeep Loyalists](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\The%20Democratic%20Combine%20of%20Peoples\Factions\Hillkeep%20Loyalists.md) make their home here. The Hillkeep Clan of Hill Dwarves founded the [Darnt Hillkeep](..\..\Southeast%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\Darnt%20Hillkeep.md) here, but could found no Kingdom, lest they wish to make war against the - at the time - powerful [Bandit Lords](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper\Local%20Lore\Bandit%20Lords.md). Now the Grumbling Hills find themselves tred upon by all manner of foot under the order of [Baron Jammu](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Barons%20of%20Combine%20NPCs\Baron%20Jammu.md), though still the Hill Dwarves most of all.
