The Great Southern Mossland is a massive field of plump wet moss that grows in [The Democratic Combine of Peoples](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\The%20Democratic%20Combine%20of%20Peoples\The%20Democratic%20Combine%20of%20Peoples.md). It is split into three baronies, each held by a separate baron; [Eastlick Mossland](Eastlick%20Mossland.md), [Westlick Mossland](Westlick%20Mossland.md), and [Centerlick Mossland](Centerlick%20Mossland.md), as well as potions of the Southern Mossland being controlled by Barons who have lost portions of their claimed territories - ie the above.

Please see the above for more information.
