The Huntyr Swamp is a medium barony, encompassing three holdings, [Red Throne](..\..\Southeast%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\Red%20Throne.md), *Falseguard*, and [Neverwallow](..\..\Southeast%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20city\Neverwallow.md). Currently, the entire swamp is under the control of the [Knights in Red](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\The%20Democratic%20Combine%20of%20Peoples\Factions\Knights%20in%20Red\Knights%20in%20Red.md).
