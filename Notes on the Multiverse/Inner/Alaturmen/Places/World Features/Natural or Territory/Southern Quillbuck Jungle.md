The Southern Quillbuck Jungle is the densest portion of the [Great Quillbuck Jungle](Great%20Quillbuck%20Jungle.md), and it is controlled and exploited by the *Harvord Trading Company* and *Baron Havord*. They control one major holding, [New Quillbuck](..\..\Southwestern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20city\New%20Quillbuck.md), but their operations span this southern section of jungle.
