# Description

## History

The Darnt Hillkeep was once two worlds. The city of Darnt, a human settlement, growing and growing faster than it can sustain, and the [Dwarven Kingdom Jammu](..\..\..\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Dwarven%20Kingdoms\Dwarven%20Kingdom%20Jammu.md)'s large, beautiful, opulent, and empty halls. When they met, it was clear that their people would become intertwined economically, but few expected as much cultural integration as what has occured.

The Halls of [Dwarven Kingdom Jammu](..\..\..\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Dwarven%20Kingdoms\Dwarven%20Kingdom%20Jammu.md) are generally known and referred to as "Hillkeep", and it is a large shallow connection of homes and work sites that make up much of the hills here.
