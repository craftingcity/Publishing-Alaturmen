*This page describes a #disambiguation.*

Central Alaturmen references *extremely generally* the people and places in the "four corners" of the nations surrounding [Coalition City](..\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Coalition%20City.md).

The most Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western points in "central" Alaturmen mark the beginning of the [Wildlands](..\..\..\Outer\Wildlands.md) in their current form.
