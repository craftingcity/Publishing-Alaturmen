# Description

Any sort of local lore...

## Physicality of the Holding

Baskin was recently attacked by a raid of Ice Giants (see [The Assault of the Giant Decenters](..\..\..\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\The%20Assault%20of%20the%20Giant%20Decenters.md)). Its stone buildings are deteriorating and rubbled, and what were once wooden structures are now piles of ash and scrap.

## Population Distribution

A large population of Orc live here, and the Grand Tendered is a green dragonborn, this leads the city to be quite exotic in comparison.
