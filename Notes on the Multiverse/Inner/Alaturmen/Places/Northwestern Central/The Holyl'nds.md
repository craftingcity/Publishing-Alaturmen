# The Holyl'nds

![Holy-100AF.png](..\..\..\..\..\MEDIA\MAPS\WORLD\Holy-100AF.png)

## History

Once, the western half of the [Great Northern Forests](..\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Great%20Northern%20Forests.md), immolated by the [Great Fires](..\..\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\Great%20Fires.md), and born anew under [Its Greatness](..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md)'s influence.

## Governance

The people that live in this area only survive long following [The Church of the White Flame](..\..\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\The%20Church%20of%20the%20White%20Flame.md). The Church rules from the *Holy City of Kanielkiln*, the final site of [Its Greatness](..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md)' recession.

## Culture

#### Heritage

Many of the first Winter Elves made their homes here before the [Great Fires](..\..\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\Great%20Fires.md) cast them from Alaturmen. Now, all that stands of the time before [Its Greatness](..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md) is [The Old](..\..\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\The%20Old.md).

Since then, people of all kinds have flocked back into the Holyl'nds to worship [Its Greatness](..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md), but [The Church of the White Flame](..\..\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\The%20Church%20of%20the%20White%20Flame.md) has a clear preference for pure human or elf in regards to social status and upwards mobility.

#### Language

The people in this area speak a common language known as [High Common (language)](..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Languages\Modern%20Languages\High%20Common%20%28language%29.md). It claims roots from ancient elven and human languages.

#### Belief

The people of the Holyl'nd revere [Its Greatness](..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md) for allowing itself to be contained and giving their peers power.
