# Who has a Horde?

## And Where?

[Kakurak](..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Kakurak.md) holds a horde at his lair near the [Firelight Sea](..\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Firelight%20Sea.md)

[Alergra Barrowinch](..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Guild%20Employee%20NPCs\Guilded%20Wizard%20NPCs\Alergra%20Barrowinch.md) holds much wealth in business and keeps a modest horde of wealth, but a great horde of magical items both on her person and in her tower in [Magius](..\Places\Northeastern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\Magius.md)

The bowels of [The Old](..\About%20People\Nations\Holyl'nds\Local%20Lore\The%20Old.md) hold a horde.

So too do the bowels of [Kailkeep](..\Places\Southwestern%20Central\Kailkeep\Kailkeep.md)

[The Old Man](..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Past%20Adventurers,%20Now%20NPCs\Grey%20Ordeal\The%20Old%20Man.md) knows the location of all the Relics of [The Grey Ordeal](..\About%20People\World%20Wide%20Happenings\Worldknown%20Groups\The%20Grey%20Ordeal.md), though he himself keeps no wealth.
