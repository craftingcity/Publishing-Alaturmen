# Authors

These people are the authors of magic items.

## Few, but Powerful

The following authors are responsible for very rare and legendary items, but due to their power, they are quite hard to come by. These authors create items that could rival the gods. (*+3 weapons*, unique items, great spellbooks and tomes)

## Many, and Mild
