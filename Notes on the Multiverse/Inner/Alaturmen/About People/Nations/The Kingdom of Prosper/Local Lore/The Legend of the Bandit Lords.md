Once upon a time, many bandit families known as the [Bandit Lords](Bandit%20Lords.md) ruled the "civilized" cities either with an iron fist or a silver tongue.

Many were hated, but respected, as none could openly oppose them. They expanded their influence and rule, creating infighting and chaos wherever they spread.

Until [Artie](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Nobles%20of%20Prosper%20NPCs\Arthur%20Simonson.md) lead a civil war to overthrow them, and [unite](Unification.md) the land.
