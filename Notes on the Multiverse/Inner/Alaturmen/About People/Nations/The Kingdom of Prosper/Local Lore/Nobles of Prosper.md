Each of the Noble Houses has a purpose in the function of the Kingdom, or so says [Arthur Simonson](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Nobles%20of%20Prosper%20NPCs\Arthur%20Simonson.md). Not only do they take care of lands, they also do business with the [Simonson Clan](..\Factions\Simonson%20Clan.md) as an entity; for example, *Noble House a'Fen* is on Simonson payroll to maintain and build new roads to a certain standard of quality. 

Each house has a job in the kingdom, a holding they control, and a seal or crest - some sort of image that represents them.
