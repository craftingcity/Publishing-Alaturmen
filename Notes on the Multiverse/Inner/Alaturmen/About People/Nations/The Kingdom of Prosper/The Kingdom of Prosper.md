# The Kingdom of Prosper

![KingdomOfProsper-105AF.png](..\..\..\..\..\..\MEDIA\MAPS\WORLD\KingdomOfProsper-105AF.png)
*a map of the Kingdom, as of 105AF*

Not but 45 years have passed since the [Great Adverturer King](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Nobles%20of%20Prosper%20NPCs\Arthur%20Simonson.md) united the lands. The city of [Yerba](..\..\..\Places\Northeastern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\Yerba.md) is the largest city in the Kingdom, second only to the [Castle Prosper](..\..\..\Places\Northeastern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\Castle%20Prosper.md) and its surrounding municipality. Many other small collectives blot the land (such as the farming community of [Moonlight](..\..\..\Places\Northeastern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20city\Moonlight.md)), connected by poorly kept cobbled roads. Much of the geography of Prosper is forested. 

## History

For much of the first century, "The Kingdom of Prosper", it was an idea in a young hobgoblin's head. 

In the very beginning, people made homes and farms here, and quickly the [Bandit Lords](Local%20Lore\Bandit%20Lords.md) came. They ruled with force, and took over the small settlements that existed. They fought against the [Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact](..\..\Non-Nation%20Entities\Blood%20Clans\Blood-Hobgoblin%20Clan%20Pact.md) and took land from the hobgoblins to make their own holdings larger. 

In [56AF](..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Timeline.md), [Arthur Simonson](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Nobles%20of%20Prosper%20NPCs\Arthur%20Simonson.md) united these lands in a civil war that many call the [Unification](Local%20Lore\Unification.md). It was a war against the [Bandit Lords](Local%20Lore\Bandit%20Lords.md) that had ruled this area. In the end, it was a great success for the people of Prosper. As each holding swore fealty to their new king, they were adorned a [Noble House](Local%20Lore\Nobles%20of%20Prosper.md) name.

## Governance

The Kingdom of Prosper is a monarchy, headed by the great [Arthur Simonson](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Nobles%20of%20Prosper%20NPCs\Arthur%20Simonson.md), and enforced by his standing army, known as Arthur's Knights. Arthur's Knights work with the [Nobles of Prosper](Local%20Lore\Nobles%20of%20Prosper.md) to defend their estates and the borders of the greater Kingdom.

The population pay taxes to maintain the cities and kingdom operations, but much of the new or temporary projects are funded by Simonson's hoard, leading to generally low taxes for the people of Prosper. Arthur hires a guild of accountants that work together with the [Guild of Merchants](..\..\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Guilds%20of%20Coalition\Guild%20of%20Merchants.md), [Guild of Crafters](..\..\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Guilds%20of%20Coalition\Guild%20of%20Crafters.md), and [Nobles of Prosper](Local%20Lore\Nobles%20of%20Prosper.md) to budget food, water, medicine, coin, and other supplies and works for the whole of the kingdom.

## Culture

#### Heritage

The citizens of the Kingdom generally are of Human or Goblin descent, or both in a large number of cases, though the Kingdom turns away none who swear fealty to the [Nobles of Prosper](Local%20Lore\Nobles%20of%20Prosper.md) and [The Great Adventurer King](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Nobles%20of%20Prosper%20NPCs\Arthur%20Simonson.md).

#### Language

The common language in Prosper is known as "the [King's Common (language)](..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Languages\Modern%20Languages\King's%20Common%20%28language%29.md)" and is based majorly on the lexicon of General Human Language, the first languages spoken by the Humans became to Alaturmen, and the syntax of Ancient Goblin. Much of the complex grammar and "extended" lexicon is also based in Ancient Elven.

#### Beliefs

Citizens of Prosper are culturally bonded by the [Unification](Local%20Lore\Unification.md) and their genuine love for the genuinely good [King Of Prosper](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Nobles%20of%20Prosper%20NPCs\Arthur%20Simonson.md). 

Most people are educated, and understand why they pay taxes and are protected by a standing military. People have no reason to fear Arthur's Knights or Truth-collectors â€“ so long as they do not lie.

The above provide the people a sense of general community and honesty, which generally leads to people loving their neighbors and accepting their strangers.

People attend temples of the Gods of Emotion when they wish to gain their favor, or if they believe in the ideals of that church, temple, or deity. 

#### Economics

Citizens of Prosper persist on stretched foods by cultural choice. Hearty grain and vegetables grow well in this area, though fruit does not. Wood and meat is abundant in this area. Much of the more expensive items are imported spices and metals.

Merchants are dishonorable crooks in the eye of the common people, but through the support of the people of means in the area, merchants import and export products west, south-west, and south.
