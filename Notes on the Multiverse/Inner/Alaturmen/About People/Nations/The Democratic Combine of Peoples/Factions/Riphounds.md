The Riphounds are [Baron Glask](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Barons%20of%20Combine%20NPCs\Baron%20Glask.md)'s personal enforcers. They hold the [Eastlick Mossland](..\..\..\..\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Eastlick%20Mossland.md) and bow to their Baron. 

They have a mild feud with the [Ranger's Guild](..\..\..\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Guilds%20of%20Coalition\Ranger's%20Guild.md), though they have been told off by the Baron - or else.
