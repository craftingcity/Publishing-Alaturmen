# The Democratic Combine of Peoples

![combine-100AF.png](..\..\..\..\..\..\MEDIA\MAPS\WORLD\combine-100AF.png)
*Combine Territory as of 100AF*

## History

The Democratic Combine of Peoples is a anarchco-fiefdom government that formed at the signing of [Coalition's Founding Document](..\..\..\Texts\Guild%20Texts\Coalition's%20Founding%20Document.md) in 078AF. Since its founding, it has experienced thirty years of easy, calm, civil war.

## Government

The Barons of the Democratic Combine of Peoples conference often, and form their own alliances and enemies between themselves. The clauses in [Coalition's Founding Document](..\..\..\Texts\Guild%20Texts\Coalition's%20Founding%20Document.md) allow anyone that holds a fief (ie enough land to feed a knight) to represent the Combine in [Communicae](..\..\Non-Nation%20Entities\Coalition%20City\Communicae.md).

When push comes to shove, the attitude of the Barons turn from competitor to defender - no-one hurts my sibling but me.

### Notable Factions

* The [Knights in Red](Factions\Knights%20in%20Red\Knights%20in%20Red.md), led by [Baron Filip](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Barons%20of%20Combine%20NPCs\Baron%20Filip.md), are a group of well meaning knights that maintain tight control of the [Huntyr Swamp](..\..\..\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Huntyr%20Swamp.md)

* [Baron Yassir Cassindil](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\High%20Power\Barons%20of%20Combine%20NPCs\Baron%20Yassir%20Cassindil.md) oversees the [Grovetenders](Factions\Grovetenders.md) and their safekeeping of the [Centerlick Mossland > Southern Third](..\..\..\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Centerlick%20Mossland.md#southern-third).

* The [Centerlick Mossland > Central Third](..\..\..\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Centerlick%20Mossland.md#central-third) is controlled by the *Baron Vannis* and his *Mossburg Enforcers*. While they are praised in *Mossburg*, the other holdings of *Baron Vannis* are much less pleased with the *Mossburg Enforcers*' work.

## Culture

#### Heritage

The People in the Democratic Combine of People are typically Goblin, Human, Triton, or any one else. While there are a lare percentage of these people here, anyone could be found in the Combine, as anyone could find use in the Combine.

#### Language

The Combine's national language is [Swampish (language)](..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Languages\Modern%20Languages\Swampish%20%28language%29.md), a blending of Triton and Human, with some syntax and grammar taken from Ancient Goblin and Elven.

#### Belief

Anyone can do anything in the Combine. This leads most people to have a I-mind-my-business-you-mind-yours attitude, with a dash of hope or despair, depending on who their loyal to and how their doing. 

People in the Combine respect their Barons only because the alternative is worse. The shift from one Baron to another can be clean or bloody, and it generally depends on the Baron. These people are Baron only because they can hold that position by force, somehow, because some people would take it from them by force if they could.

Many people in the Combine worship the Physical Idols as well as the Emotional Gods. The land in the Combine is a melting pot of theism as much as people.
