The Great Fires describe a twenty year period of time where [Its Greatness](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md) near indiscriminately burnt away all evidence of life. After reaching what is now the clear border between [The Church of the White Flame](..\The%20Church%20of%20the%20White%20Flame.md) and [The Kingdom of Prosper](..\..\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper.md), [Its Greatness](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md) retreated to [Kanielkiln](..\..\..\..\Places\Northwestern%20Central\Smaller%20than%20a%20feature\The%20Holy%20City%20of%20Kanielkiln.md) and contained itself there. Soon the people would flock back to the [The Holyl'nds](..\..\..\..\Places\Northwestern%20Central\The%20Holyl'nds.md) and worship [Its Greatness](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Absolute%20Power\Alaturmian%20God%20NPCs\Its%20Greatness.md) as their fickle master.

Only human and elven children under five were spared; of them, the surviving formed the faction [Cenva Minyo](..\..\..\Non-Nation%20Entities\Cenva%20Minyo.md) and have sworn vengeance for their fallen parents.
