Macht's Orcs are the first band of [Orc Specifics](..\..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Heritages\Orc%20Specifics.md) brought to the plane of Alaturmen. They were used by slaves by the Cheiftan Whats-His-Name during his life and in [The Assault of the Giant Decenters](..\Local%20Lore\The%20Assault%20of%20the%20Giant%20Decenters.md), at which point he was slain, and his name was lost to time, and his slaves were freed! 

New orcs of this clan are born to their flesh-giver and [Macht](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Weak%20Power\Orcish%20Shamans\Macht.md), but soon he will be too old, and other shamans shall rise and form their own clans. Almost certainly, one of these born to him (perhaps specifically *his first born mage*) would take his name and place for the existing clan, just as others would for their shaman.
