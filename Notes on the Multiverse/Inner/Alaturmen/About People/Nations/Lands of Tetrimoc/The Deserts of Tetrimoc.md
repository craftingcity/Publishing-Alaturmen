# Deserts of Tetrimoc

![Tetrimoc-100AF.png](..\..\..\..\..\..\MEDIA\MAPS\WORLD\Tetrimoc-100AF.png)

## History

## Governance

### Government of [The Golden City](..\..\..\Places\Southwestern%20Central\The%20Golden%20City\The%20Golden%20City.md)

While many in the Golden City claim that all of the desert is ruled by [Tetrimoc](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Tetrimoc.md), he has grown complacent (or simply bored), and leaves the [Outlanders](The%20Outlands.md) to themselves. Tetrimoc apparently controls the immediate area around the Golden City, and the [Outlanders](The%20Outlands.md) control the rest of the Desert, given that it has been [a few years](..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Timeline.md) since Tetrimoc has been seen in the city.

"Tetrimoc" rules with a golden claw; much like an iron fist, but more benevolent and more ruthless. His followers are much the same. [The Golden City](..\..\..\Places\Southwestern%20Central\The%20Golden%20City\The%20Golden%20City.md) is a safe place to be, as it is protected by the [Golden Claws](Factions\Golden%20Claws.md), but those who protect also enforce. They are called "Claws" for a reason.

The Claws also patrol around the area claimed for [Tetrimoc](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Tetrimoc.md) on their war wyverns, but would not stray far from the city. They know that a band of Thieves are a mighty foe for their patrol. Generally, if a Claw does encounter a band, they both respectfully turn the other way and do something else. The Nomads get no such treatment.

### Thieves

The Thieves follow [The Code of Thieves](Local%20Lore\The%20Code%20of%20Thieves.md). By all following these simple ideals, they

Three "teams" of thieves have become very well established, and fight against each other and the four or more nomadic collectives for the few and far between resources in the desert. The "teams" are each named after and headed by a "team captain" who has proven themself in their own way. Currently, the three teams are lead by [Agrandica](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Mild%20Power\Thief%20Lords%20of%20the%20Desert\Agrandica.md), [Barthalamule](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Mild%20Power\Thief%20Lords%20of%20the%20Desert\Barthalamule.md), and [Cobalt](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\Mild%20Power\Thief%20Lords%20of%20the%20Desert\Cobalt.md).

Food, water, and medicine are primary concerns, while ammunition and weaponry are secondary. Raw resources such as wood, stone, and metal are tertiary, as the Thieves rarely make - preferring to maintain - permanent structures.

The thieves husband Camel and raise them for war. Each team has perhaps 50 trained camel to use at their disposal across each of their bases.

### Nomads

The nomadic tribes of this area are, like thieves, forceful with their resource gathering, but unlike the thieves, few live to tell their tales. Food is a scarcity in the desert, and unlike the Thieves, the nomads do not grow and steal their food, but rather opt to eat whatever they can catch.

Many people in [The Golden City](..\..\..\Places\Southwestern%20Central\The%20Golden%20City\The%20Golden%20City.md) tell tales of the cannibalistic nomads of the Outlands and, while meant to be exaggerated, most are true.

## Culture

### Golden City-zens

#### Heritage

People of all heritage come to behold the city in the desert, but the first people that came here, to [Tetrimoc](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Tetrimoc.md)'s lair, were Human. Gnoll and Goblin are not welcome in the Golden City, but they are here anyways.

#### Language

The language spoken in the City in Gold is a dialect of [Desertspeech (language)](..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Languages\Modern%20Languages\Desertspeech%20%28language%29.md) that heavily favors its [Draconic (language)](..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Languages\Ancestral%20Languages\Time%20Before%20Time\Draconic%20%28language%29.md) roots.

#### Beliefs

The people of the City in Gold worship [Tetrimoc](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Tetrimoc.md). The [Golden Claws](Factions\Golden%20Claws.md) have claimed to speak for [Tetrimoc](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Tetrimoc.md) in his absence, and the people have believed them and accepted their harsh rule.

#### Economics

The systems and laws put into place by the [Golden Claws](Factions\Golden%20Claws.md) have created a very large divide between the rich and poor. There is a very small middle class, and progressing from beyond this status is extremely difficult.

The thieves have a cultural disposition against death or taking the life of another. Generally, they use blunted weaponry and ammunition, but some of the more powerful members carry and use *Durandurm Weaponry*.

#### Symbolism

### Nomads

#### Heritage

#### Language

#### Beliefs

The nomads do not share the thieves' cultural value of life. They generally use their natural weapons, preferring bladed weaponry secondarily. After maiming their prey, they remove them to consume their fresh kill. If necessary, a nomad will die trying to defend their kill, tools, or pack.
