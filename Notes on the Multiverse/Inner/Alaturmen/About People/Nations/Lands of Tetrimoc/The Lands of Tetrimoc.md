## The Deserts of Tetrimoc

### Government of [The Golden City](..\..\..\Places\Southwestern%20Central\The%20Golden%20City\The%20Golden%20City.md)

While many in the Golden City claim that all of the desert is ruled by [Tetrimoc](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Tetrimoc.md), he has grown complacent (or simply bored), and leaves the [Outlanders](The%20Outlands.md) to themselves. Tetrimoc apparently controls the immediate area around the Golden City, and the [Outlanders](The%20Outlands.md) control the rest of the Desert, given that it has been [a few years](..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Timeline.md) since Tetrimoc has been seen in the city.

"Tetrimoc" rules with a golden claw; much like an iron fist, but more benevolent and more ruthless. His followers are much the same. [The Golden City](..\..\..\Places\Southwestern%20Central\The%20Golden%20City\The%20Golden%20City.md) is a safe place to be, as it is protected by the [Golden Claws](Factions\Golden%20Claws.md), but those who protect also enforce. They are called "Claws" for a reason.

The Claws also patrol around the area claimed for [Tetrimoc](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Tetrimoc.md) on their war wyverns, but would not stray far from the city. They know that a band of Thieves are a mighty foe for their patrol. Generally, if a Claw does encounter a band, they both respectfully turn the other way and do something else. The Nomads get no such treatment.

### The Tournament

While the Thieves are often left to their own devices, [The Golden City](..\..\..\Places\Southwestern%20Central\The%20Golden%20City\The%20Golden%20City.md) hosts [Tetrimoc's Tournament of Glory](Local%20Lore\Tetrimoc's%20Tournament%20of%20Glory.md) for the most affluent class to spectate. Many Thieves come and fight for sport here, and a Thief that wins is given glorious treasure; this bounty is always enough to move the winners and their family many many classes above where they were before. This is supposedly sponsored by [Tetrimoc](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Tetrimoc.md)'s horde.

### Population Distribution and Language

The desert's common is largely based on the languages of Dragons and Gnolls; draconic and abyssal respectively. This language is called [Desertspeech (language)](..\..\..\..\..\Big%20Lore\Languages\Modern%20Languages\Desertspeech%20%28language%29.md).

Population distribution is as follows; one may...

* commonly find the "races of men", such as human, halflings, dwarves
* commonly find the "monstrous races", such as gnoll and "domesticated  #goblinoid"
* uncommonly find elven folk
* uncommonly find the "exotic races" such as dragonborn, goliaths, tiefling, kenku
