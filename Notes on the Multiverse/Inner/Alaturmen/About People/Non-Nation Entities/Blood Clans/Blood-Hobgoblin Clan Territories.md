*North-east Alaturmen circa 100AF.*

## History

In the time before time, the goblinoid were united as one. Thirty-two years after [Tetrimoc](..\..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\NPCs\ala%20Alaturmen\zNon-Humanoid\Draconic%20NPCs\Tetrimoc.md) fell, and after thirty-two years of subjugation by the [Bandit Lords](..\..\Nations\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper\Local%20Lore\Bandit%20Lords.md), the Hobgoblin of the Eastern half of the [Great Northern Forests](..\..\..\Places\World%20Features\Natural%20or%20Territory\Great%20Northern%20Forests.md) wrote and signed the [Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact](Blood-Hobgoblin%20Clan%20Pact.md) before making war against all others. After the fall of the [Bandit Lords](..\..\Nations\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper\Local%20Lore\Bandit%20Lords.md) and many years, these Clans made peace with their newest neighbor; [The Kingdom of Prosper](..\..\Nations\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper\The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prosper.md).

Not long after their peace, they turned on each other, though they were never truly allied, and they still fight in the north-east forests of [Central Alaturmen](..\..\..\Places\Central%20Alaturmen.md).

## Governance

Each of the Clans is ruled by one Hobgoblin, the Mangugu, who answers to up to twelve Gurr'ix-Yuggwulp, advisor-concubines, and must be near three Alman, basically bodyguards, at all times.

Seven family names reside on the [Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact](Blood-Hobgoblin%20Clan%20Pact.md);
