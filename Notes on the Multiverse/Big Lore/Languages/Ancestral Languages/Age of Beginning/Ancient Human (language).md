Ancient Human is a collection of languages spoken by the first humans of Alaturmen. Quickly, these languages were forced to merge with other ancestral languages, and the languages of [Swampish (language)](..\..\Modern%20Languages\Swampish%20%28language%29.md), [Desertspeech (language)](..\..\Modern%20Languages\Desertspeech%20%28language%29.md), [High Common (language)](..\..\Modern%20Languages\High%20Common%20%28language%29.md), and [King's Common (language)](..\..\Modern%20Languages\King's%20Common%20%28language%29.md) were formed. Due to their common heritage in the languages of the ancient humans, communication between these languages is possible, but stunted.
