Draconic is the language of the ancient *Immortal Dragons*, their *kin*, and [mages](..\..\..\..\..\Game%20Notes\Mechanics\How%20the%20Weave%20becomes%20Magic.md). 

True-dragon have no lips, certain sounds that a human could make are omitted from its phonology, including *p* in "put", *b* in "but", *m* in "maybe", *f* in "fish", and *v* in "valedictorian".
