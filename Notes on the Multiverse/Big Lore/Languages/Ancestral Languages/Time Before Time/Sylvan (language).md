Sylvan is the language of the [Ceilie Courts](..\..\..\..\Inner\Feywild\Ceilie%20Courts.md) of the [Feywild](..\..\..\..\Inner\Feywild\Feywild.md).

Sylvan sounds more fluid than Elvish, and more complex. A creature who is non-fey has great difficulty maintaining conversation in this language, overwhelmed by the auditory and emotional input the language requires.
