King's Common is the language spoken by most people in the north-east of [Central Alaturmen](..\..\..\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Central%20Alaturmen.md), and is a passable humanoid trade language.

It claims its roots in the languages of the first conversations between the humans and goblins who gathered in this area.
