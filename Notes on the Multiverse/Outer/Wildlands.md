# Wildlands

## From Alaturmen to Beyond

The Wildlands are a fine protective plane that merges Alaturmen with the other #planes of the Multiverse.

#### To the Inner Planes

When passing this fine planar layer, if one enters with and maintains their focus, one emerges in an [Inner](..\Inner\Inner.md) plane of their choosing. If one fails to do so, they are cast about the planes, becoming thrust into the [Elemental Planes](..\Inner\Elemental%20Planes\Elemental%20Planes.md), the [Astral Sea](Astral%20Sea.md), or, Gods forbid, an [Outer](Outer.md) plane such as [Limbo](Limbo\Limbo.md) or [Abyss](Abyss\Abyss.md).

#### To the Outer Planes

It is in this fine layer that a Alaturmenian Spirit waits for a ride on the River Styx to one of the [Outer](Outer.md) planes.
