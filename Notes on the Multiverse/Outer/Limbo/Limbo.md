# Limbo

## The Outer Plane of Ideal Neutrality

Limbo is a flat plane infinite size. There is no light here, yet there is no darkness either. Limbo's only two features are the uncountable swaths of souls wandering here and [The Tower of Limbo](Places\The%20Tower%20of%20Limbo.md), an obelisk infinite in size, floating directly above the center of the plane.
