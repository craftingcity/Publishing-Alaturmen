The Wakquk Twins, *Marley Hurraquk* and *Lily-Mae Garqwak*, were born to [Gail Wakquk](Gail%20Wakquk.md), who ruled a great portion of the [Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Territories](Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\About%20People\Non-Nation%20Entities\Blood%20Clans\Blood-Hobgoblin%20Clan%20Territories.md) in [Northeastern Central](Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Places\Northeastern%20Central\Northeastern%20Central.md) [Alaturmen](Notes%20on%20the%20Multiverse\Inner\Alaturmen\Alaturmen.md). After Gail's death, her allies supported one of her two children over the other; neither had a clear claim to the matriarchy as they were born on the same day. As civil war broke, the *Hurraquk Clan* and the *Garqwak Clan* were formed. The twins have refused to speak since they have made tenuous, although heavily supported, peace.
